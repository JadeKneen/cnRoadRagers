<h1>Road Ragers</h1>

This is the repository for Team 5 (Road Ragers) for the Space Invaders project at Code Nation.

The brief was to create a game following the classic Space Invader's game format.

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>Javascript
<li>Canvas
<li>VS Code
</ul>

<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
<ol>
<li>Three rows of 'aliens' will appear at the top of the screen, moving from left to right.
<li>The player will control a gun which will move from left to right.
<li>The player needs to hit the aliens by shotting the gun.
<li>If the player hits and clears all the aliens by the time the timer hits 0, they win the game.
<li>If the player does not clear all the aliens then they lose the game.
</ol>

<h2>Future plans</h2>
Going further, we would have wanted to adapt the game by replacing the 'blocks' with cars to recreate the driving style game.
